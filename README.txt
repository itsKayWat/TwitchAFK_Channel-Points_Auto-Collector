TwitchAFK - Channel Points Auto-Collector
=======================================

Purpose:
--------
TwitchAFK automates the collection of Twitch channel points across multiple streams simultaneously. It runs quietly in the background and works with a Chrome extension to provide an easy-to-use interface for managing your points.

Why Use It:
-----------
- Automatically collect channel points without active watching
- Monitor multiple streams at once
- Track point accumulation through a clean interface
- Save time and never miss points
- Perfect for users who want to unlock channel rewards but can't actively watch streams

Requirements:
------------
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Chrome browser
- Windows/Mac/Linux operating system
- Internet connection

Installation:
------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TwitchAFK.git

2. Install requirements:
   python requirements.py

3. Load Chrome extension:
   - Open Chrome
   - Navigate to chrome://extensions/
   - Enable "Developer mode"
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the "twitch_points_manager" folder

Usage Example:
-------------
A typical use case would be a Twitch viewer who follows multiple streamers and wants to unlock channel-specific rewards. Instead of keeping multiple tabs open and actively clicking the bonus button, TwitchAFK handles everything automatically:

1. Start the Python script
2. Log in to your Twitch account when prompted
3. Add your favorite channels through the extension
4. Let it run in the background
5. Check your points accumulation through the extension

The tool will handle everything else - claiming points, tracking totals, and managing multiple streams simultaneously.
